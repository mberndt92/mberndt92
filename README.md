## Overview of my Projects
Below I'm sharing an overview of my public repositories, an overview of the features of each repository as well as the tech used.
This is something I created for myself so I have an easy way to find projects I used certain techniques in to re-use those or check the implementation one more time.

If you are interested, jump to the repository side.
I tried to upload animated gifs showing the main features for most of them.
