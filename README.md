# Hi there 👋
A few pieces of information about me, since you made it all the way to my GitHub profile.

- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- 🌱 I’m currently learning: SwiftUI as part of #100DaysOfSwiftUI
- 🧗 I love to go bouldering in my free time
- 🥘 Did I mention already I'm a big foodie ?

## Overview of my Projects
Below I'm sharing an overview of my public repositories, an overview of the features of each repository as well as the tech used.
This is something I created for myself so I have an easy way to find projects I used certain techniques in to re-use those or check the implementation one more time.

If you are interested, jump to the repository side.
I tried to upload animated gifs showing the main features for most of them.
